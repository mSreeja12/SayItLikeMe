# 🎙️ SayItLikeMe (Transformer Edition)

**SayItLikeMe** is a transformer-powered voice cloning and text-to-speech (TTS) system based on **YourTTS**, capable of mimicking a speaker's voice from just 10–30 seconds of audio. Built on top of FastSpeech2 with multilingual support and speaker embedding conditioning, this project enables ultra-realistic speech generation in any voice.
