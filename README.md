## üéôÔ∏è Voice Cloning with Bark/Coqui TTS

This project demonstrates how to clone a speaker's voice using advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. It uses the [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) library to extract speaker embeddings from a reference audio and generate new speech in the same voice, with optional support for Bark-style outputs.

---

### üîß Features

* Clone voice from any `.wav` sample.
* Generate speech using cloned voice.
* Easily switch between models (e.g., Bark, VITS, Tacotron2).
* Python and Jupyter Notebook compatible.
* High-quality, realistic speech synthesis.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-cloning.git
cd voice-cloning
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Requirements include: `TTS`, `torchaudio`, `librosa`, `IPython`, `numpy`, and others depending on your model.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

#### 1. Provide a reference voice sample

Place a `.wav` file in the root directory (e.g., `user_audio.wav`) with clear, clean speech of the target speaker.

#### 2. Run the notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook or use Colab and run `Voice_Cloning.ipynb`. It will:

* Load the model
* Extract speaker embedding
* Generate new speech from your custom text

#### 3. Output

The generated voice will be saved as `output.wav`, and you can play it directly in the notebook.

---

### üìå Notes

* The reference voice should be mono-channel and recorded at 16 kHz or 22 kHz.
* GPU support is highly recommended for faster synthesis.
